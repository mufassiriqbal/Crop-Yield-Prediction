# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction & Recommendation Calculator  

This project is an **AI-powered web calculator** that predicts the **best crop** for given soil and weather conditions and estimates the **expected crop yield**.  
It uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier & Regressor)** with a **Gradio-based web interface**, making it easy for farmers, researchers, and students to test predictions.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Crop recommendation based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), weather, pH, and rainfall  
- Yield prediction (tons/hectare) for the recommended crop  
- Interactive **Gradio web app** with sliders/inputs  
- Runs on **Google Colab**, Hugging Face Spaces, or locally  
- Public shareable URL for instant access  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (data handling)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML models)  
- **Gradio** (Web UI)

## 📊 Dataset  
The project currently uses a **sample dataset** with soil nutrients, climate parameters, crop types, and yields.  
You can extend it with real-world datasets such as:  
- [Kaggle Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)  
- Government/FAO agricultural statistics
